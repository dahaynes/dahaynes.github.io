            Currently, I am an Assistant Professor with the Institute for Health Informatics at the University of Minnesota. I
            am a broadly trained health geographer who uses cutting-edge spatial analysis methods to advance our knowledge of
            health
            and cancer disparities. I employ GIScience methods and big data tools to answer substantive research questions about
            disparities and whether dynamics of place (location and time) increases the prevalence of disease in specific
            sub-populations. I also employ GIScience methods—spatial analysis, geocomputation, and geovisulization—to
            communicate this knowledge to health researchers, practitioners, and broader communities.

                Smart Community Health is Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) point of care platform. Smart Community Health addresses
                SDoH needs (i.e., housing, poverty, food insecurity), through a innovate collaborative data-sharing platform that
                connects community resources to community needs.

                Spatial Online Analytical Platforms (SOLAP) are a group of tools that allow users to interact and learn about spatial data.
                Spatial data remains an elusive tool for novice researcher who seek to understand how place affects outcomes. 
                SOLAP provides a series of tools that allow users to interact and perform spatial analysis functions with needing access to sophisticated GIS software.
